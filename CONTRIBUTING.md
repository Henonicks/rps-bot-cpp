# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please do not feel intimidated! We welcome
PRs from developers of all levels of experience and we were all new once.

## Pull Request Process

1. Pull requests should be made against the `dev` branch.
2. Ensure that you do not break any existing API calls without discussing on
Discord first!
3. Be sure to follow the coding style guide (if you are not sure, match the
code style of existing files including indent style etc.).
4. Your PR must pass the CI actions before being allowed to be merged
(unless the CI actions are broken).
5. Automated changes e.g. via Grammarly or a static analysis tool will not
usually be accepted into the code without proper thought out justification (by
a human being, not an AI or an App) as to why the changes are required.
Generally a PR should do more than fix a single spelling error for example as
this just takes precious time for something which could have been resolved by a
direct commit to the `dev` branch.
